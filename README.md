## What is it?
The Pomodoro Task Manager is a productivity tool that combines a customizable To-do list with the popular Pomodoro technique to help you stay focused and organized. This application includes features for tracking tasks, setting a timer for focused work sessions, and personalizing the app’s aesthetics to suit your preferences.

**Features:**
- Pomodoro Timer, adjustable for work and break periods
- "Who's that Pokémon?" game that pops up after the work period timer ends (Pokémon API used here)

And once you sign in through Firebase Authentication you can also modify a ...
- To-do list that is attached to a Firestore collection component for each signed-in user
- Completed tasks list attached to a separate Firestore collection; this is added to once tasks are completed and removed from the To-do list
- Fun jokes that pop up every time you check off an item on your to-do list! (Jokes API used here)

## What was this built with?
Firebase, React, Vite, & some APIs!
